## Retro-Space-Shooter

A space shooting game made over the course of 2 days using the ncurses library.

This was done as part of the C++ Picine of the 42 cursus

use `make` then `./ft_retro` to run the game.

I recommend that you reduce the size of your terminal window and zoom in a bit for the best experiance.

Enjoy!
